Join James Marcaccio, GIS and Data Systems Specialist, for this introduction to creating basic maps using R. You'll learn how to: identify packages and basic functions for mapping in R,
import and generate geospatial data, and plot your data on a map for use in a research paper or poster."
prereqs: "Attendees must have a working version of R and RStudio to participate in this workshop. Prior experience in R is required. While we will cover some basics, it is expected that participants know how to install and load packages, define variables, and create and run functions in RStudio."
